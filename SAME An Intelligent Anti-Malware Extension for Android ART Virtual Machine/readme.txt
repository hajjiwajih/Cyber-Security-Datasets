It is well known that cyber criminal gangs are already using advanced and especially intelligent types of Android malware, in order to overcome the out-of-band security measures. This is done in order to broaden and enhance their attacks which mainly target financial and credit foundations and their transactions. It is a fact that most applications used under the Android system are written in Java. The research described herein, proposes the development of an innovative active security system that goes beyond the limits of the existing ones. The developed system acts as an extension on the ART (Android Run Time) Virtual Machine architecture, used by the Android Lolipop 5.0 version.  Its main task is the analysis and classification of the Java classes of each application. It is a flexible intelligent system with low requirements in computational resources, named Smart Anti Malware Extension (SAME)... http://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-319-24306-1_23
